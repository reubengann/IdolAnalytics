BillboardSongs
--------------

All songs from the Hot 100, 1890-2015, all songs found played on the radio in the Statistical Snapshot of American Radio, and every song ever sung on American Idol. Compiled from the Whitburn spreadsheet and from my own data mining. Note that there are songs found on the SSAR that did not chart. In that case, many fields are null. This refers to the compiled list found on USENET, updated regularly. It was current as of the beginning of 2015, but I have not maintained it since.
